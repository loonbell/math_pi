# math_pi
A simple program that calculate an estimation of the value of pi by the pythagorean theorem.

The higher the value inputed, the higher the accuracy of pi will be (theoretically... float can sometime be inacurate).

The program is basically a mathematical proof that pi is really equal to pi, and that schools don't lie to us.
